Lesson 1 Exercises - React Basics, JSX
Recommended: create a copy of react basics.html to do these exercises.
1a. Using React, display a button on the website with  the text "Good Job!" inside the button
1b. Using React, display a paragraph with the text "My name is [NAME]" on the website (replace [NAME] with your name).

My name is Jaya

1c. Create the design on the right and display it in the wevsure using React.

1d. You buy 1 pack of socks for $10 and 2 T-shirts for $8 each. Using JS, calculate the total cost of this order, save it in a variable named productCost, 
and display it in the Console.

1e. Continuing from 1d, insert the productCost variable into a paragraph element, create the design below and display it on the website.

Product cost:$_

Challenge Exercises
1f. Continuing from le, let's pretend the shipping cost is $5. Save this in a variable named shippingCost, calculate the total cost using JavaScript 
(productCost + shippingCost), and display the results on the website using the design below:

Product cost: $_A
Shipping cost: $_B
Total cost: $_C_
Place your order

Note: replace _A_ and insert productCost, replace _B_ and insert shippingCost, replace _C_ and insert the total cost.

1g. We're going to load the DayJS external library on the website (DayJS is an external library that helps us work with dates easier).
• To load DayJS, create a <script> above your code, and load the URL: https://unpkg.com/supersimpledev/dayjs.js
• After DayJS is loaded, use the code: dayjs().format('MMMM D') to get the current date. Display
this result in the console.

Console: August 28

1h. Continuing from 1g, insert the date in a paragraph element, and display it on the website in this format:
Console: Today is August 28

1i. Using DayJS, get the current time using dayjs().format('HH:mm:ss') and display it on the website in this format:

    Current time: 21:39:28

1j. We'll create a clock. Continue from exercise 1i. and do these steps: 
• First, instead of doing ReactDOM.createRoot(...).render(...); 
  save the root in a variable const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(...); 
  and then do root.render(.......);
• Use the JavaScript code: setInterval(() => {}, 1000);
  (replace ... with some code and it will run this code every second).
• Inside setInterval, display the current time
  on the website using root.render(...); 
  (setInterval will run this code every second and this will create a clock).
