- **LocalStorage API** - Data persistence

## Component Architecture

### App.js (Root)
- Manages global state (selectedDate, tasks, profileImage)
- Calculates streak and scores
- Handles all state mutations
- Coordinates between components

### Components
1. **Header** - Profile, name, and statistics display
2. **DayPlanner** - Complete day planning interface with task management

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Click "Change Date" button to select a different day
3. Type what you did or plan to do in the task input
4. Press "Add Task" or hit Enter to save
5. Click the ○ circle to mark task as complete (earns points!)
6. Click ✓ checkmark to mark incomplete
7. Completed tasks show with strikethrough and green background
8. Watch your streak grow by completing tasks daily!
9. Track your total points in the header

## State Management

- **selectedDate**: Current day being viewed/edited
- **tasks**: Array of task objects with completion status and points
- **profileImage**: Profile picture URL (stored in localStorage)

## Scoring Rules

- Each task = 10 points when completed
- Points only count when task is marked as done
- Day score = sum of completed tasks for that day
- Total score = sum of all completed tasks ever

## Streak Calculation

- Streak counts consecutive days with at least one completed task
- Breaks if you miss a day
- Calculated backwards from today
- Encourages daily engagement

## Future Enhancements

- Upload custom profile picture
- Adjustable points per task
- Task categories with different point values
- Weekly/monthly score summaries
- Export task history
- Task time tracking
- Reminders and notifications
- Dark mode toggle
- Achievement badges

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers with ES6 support and localStorage enabled.
