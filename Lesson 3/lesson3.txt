State, Event Handlers
We'll create a simple counter app.
Recommended: start with an empty React website to do with these exercises.

3a. Create a button with the text "Clicked 0 times". When you click this button, display "Clicked" in the console. (Hint: use onClick)

3b. Using React.useState(), save a count. The count should have an initial value of 0, and React.useState() should return 2 values:
count (the current data) and setCount (the updater function).
    • Update the text in the button so it displays the count instead of 0.
    • When clicking the button, usethe updater function to increase the count by 1. Click the button a few times to test your code.

3c. Update the text in the button so that if count is equal to 1, the text is  "Clicked 1 time" instead of  "Clicked 1 times".

3d. Separate the counter into a component. Then, use this compoenent to create 1 counterson the website. Click both counters a few times to test it.
Notice, each counter can have a different count.

3e. Make both counters display the same count. You can do this by lifting the state up, and sharing it between the counters.

3f. Create a reset button that resets the count to 0 for all the counters.

We'll create a display-as-you-type app.
3g. Start from an empty React website and create an <input> and a <p>. As you type in the <input>, the test you type should also appear in the <p>
with "Hello" in front of it. (Hint: use onChange, save the text in state, and insert it in the JSX).

3h. Add 2 buttons beside the <input>, "Reset" and "Example".
    • When clicking the Reset button, it removes the text in the <input>
    • When clicking the Example button, it sets an example text in the <input>, like "Alice" (or any name you want).
    • Hint: use a controlled input.

Challenge Exercises
In the next exercises, we'll add code to chatbot.html
3i. Instead of clicking the "Send" button, we can also send a message by pressing "Enter" on our keyboard. We'll add this feature to the project.
    • Add a new event prop onKeyDown to the <input>. This runs a function each time we press a key on our keyboard.
    • The function gets an event parameter, and we can get the key that was pressed using event.key
    • If event.key is 'Enter', send the message.

3j. If we type in the <input> and press "Esc" (or "Escape") it should remove the text ub the <input>.
    • Hint: check if event.key is 'Escape'

3k. In the real world, the Chatbot does not respond immediately, it takes some time to think, and then respond (see the final Chatbot project). We'll learn
how to handle this situation.
    • Change Chatbot.getResponse to Chatbot.getResponseAsync (for this function, the Chatbot thinks for a second, and then responds).
    • Chatbot.getResponseAsync returns a promise (promise = a value that is not availability yet, but will be available in the future).
    • Add await in front of Chatbot.getResponseAsync to wait for it to finish (wait for the value to be available before continuing).
    • Add async in front of function sendMessage() (because we can only use await inside an async function).
    • As a review, this is a JavaScript feature called async/await

3l. Now that we wait for the Chatbot's response, let's improve the app:
    • Update the code so it removes the text in the textbox right after sending our message (otherwise, the text will stay in the textbox for a while, 
    until the response is ready, which doesn't look good).
    • While waiting for the Chatbot's response, display a "Loading..." message and remove it after (see final Chatbot project).

3m. Add an isLoading state to <ChatInput> that represents if it's loading (waiting for a response from the chatbot).
    • If it is loading, don't allow sending a new message.
    • Also, don't allow sending a new message if inputText is empty.
